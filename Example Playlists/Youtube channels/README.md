AIOPlayer
=========

The ultimate All in One Player playlist section
These playlists are the same which are in the default install but the Uri's are changed so they can be downloaded directly from github.
I invite everybody to upload his playlist with public channels. Please keep complete sets together with four playlist and the used images.

1. master.asx
This is the mean playlist and it points to the location of the other three playlists.

2. default.asx
This playlist contains the channels that start playing when the AIOPlayer starts. The intent is to have or a background channel or view your cameras.

3. tv.asx
This playlist contains channels you want to access quicky. So it contains references to channels and icons for each channel.
These icons are displayed in the channels pane as buttons. You can play the channel by pressing the button. This is designed typically for watching TV or internet channels.

4. homecontrol.asx
This playlist renders a browser on the main page. You can customize it with pages you want to access easily and quick, e.g. home automation controls.
This playlist contains references to urls and corresponding icons. The icons will be rendered as buttons.

AIOPlayer is based on ZonePlayer https://github.com/beejones/ZonePlayer
