The ultimate All in One Player


People like to put AIO (All In One) PC's or other machines in their office or kitchen. They are used for work, entertainment and
home automation.
Common tasks are viewing camera's, watching TV and controlling the home automation system.

This is exactly for which AIOPlayer is designed.

Home Automation and watching TV channels are very custom tasks. That's why AIOPlayer is full customizable by means of ASX playlists.

AIOPlayer has three customizable sections controlled by four playlists. The directory SamplePlaylists contains samples for each of the 
playlists.

1. master.asx
This is the mean playlist and it points to the location of the other three playlists.

2. default.asx
This playlist contains the channels that start playing when the AIOPlayer starts. The intent is to have or a background channel or view your cameras.

3. tv.asx
This playlist contains channels you want to access quicky. So it contains references to channels and icons for each channel.
These icons are displayed in the channels pane as buttons. You can play the channel by pressing the button. This is designed typically for watching TV or internet channels.

4. homecontrol.asx
This playlist renders a browser on the main page. You can customize it with pages you want to access easily and quick, e.g. home automation controls.
This playlist contains references to urls and corresponding icons. The icons will be rendered as buttons.
